				<h2><br>A Quick Introduction!</h2>
				<p><br>Hi! My name is Jhilmil and welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a senior year 
					college student and looking for opportunities to work in a fast-paced environment. Usually, when <br>I'm not 
					studying or working or stressing out about future, you'd most likely see me trying out new 
					restaurants or taking small weekend trips. Think we can connect? Feel free to contact me!</p>

			<h3>Bachelor of Science, Computer Science <br>Minor: Technology Management</h3>
			<p><br>I've never been able to settle for the amount of knowledge I have. I've always looked out for ways to 
					learn new things and broaden my horizon. During my freshmen year of college, I decided to take up an 
					introductory course to computer science, <br>which striked my interest and I was amazed to learn that this 
					field is still growing and that there is no limit to how much one can learn. This field provides endless 
					opportunities, which is the sole reason why I want to pursue my career in this field.</p>
					<p>Having taken various courses in the field of Computer Science, I've found my interest in 
						front-end development and love keeping myself up to date with the new technologies. </p>
